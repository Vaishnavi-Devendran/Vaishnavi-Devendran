Here are some of the projects I've been working on.

## Spectro-transformer: A Slimmed Architecture for Low-Light Image Restoration
Summary: My Master's dissertation focused on developing a lightweight deep learning model for low-light image enhancement, optimizing it for use on resource-constrained devices. I successfully reduced the model's parameters from over 2.5 million to just 1.42 million.

Key Achievement: My model achieved a state-of-the-art PSNR of 34.67 dB and a competitive NIQE score of 3.47 on unseen datasets, showcasing its efficiency and generalization capabilities.

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Computer Vision

## Multi-Report Analysis App
Summary: Developed a data processing application that automates the analysis of multiple reports, converting them into structured data. The app extracts key metrics and provides visualizations for efficient business analysis.

Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Streamlit (for the UI)


## AI Recruitment System
Summary: Built a deep learning system to analyze candidate responses in interviews using real-time emotion prediction. The system uses computer vision to analyze eye gaze and blink rate to provide data-driven insights.

Key Achievement: Architected the system using Mediapipe, achieving 95% accuracy in facial landmark detection to analyze candidate engagement and emotional state during assessments.

Technologies: Python, Keras, Mediapipe, OpenCV, Computer Vision

## Automated Machine Learning Platform Development
Summary: Supported the backend development of a user-friendly automated ML platform, automating model building and delivering scalable analytics solutions. I integrated H2O, PyCaret, and Auto-ARIMA frameworks to increase data coverage by 20%.

Key Achievement: The project's pipeline automated data preprocessing, feature engineering, and feature selection, reducing model training time by 35%.

Technologies: Python, Autoarima, h2o, pycaret
