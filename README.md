üî≠ My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on.

Spectro-transformer: A Slimmed Architecture for Low-Light Image Restoration
Summary: My Master's dissertation focused on developing a lightweight deep learning model for low-light image enhancement, optimizing it for use on resource-constrained devices. I successfully reduced the model's parameters from over 2.5 million to just 1.42 million.

Key Achievement: My model achieved a state-of-the-art PSNR of 34.67 dB and a competitive NIQE score of 3.47 on unseen datasets, showcasing its efficiency and generalization capabilities.

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Computer Vision

AI Recruitment System
Summary: Built a deep learning system to analyze candidate responses in interviews using real-time emotion prediction.

Technologies: Python, Keras, Mediapipe, OpenCV, Computer Vision

Automated Machine Learning Platform Development
Summary: Supported the backend development of a user-friendly automated ML platform, automating model building and delivering scalable analytics solutions.

Technologies: Python, Autoarima, h2o, pycaret
